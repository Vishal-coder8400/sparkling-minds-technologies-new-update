i dont like this color keep light color not too dark“Design a modern, clean SaaS homepage hero inspired by Flowbite-style layouts: left-aligned headline ‘Payments tool for software companies,’ short subheading paragraph, and two CTAs side-by-side — primary solid button ‘Get started’ and secondary ghost button ‘Speak to Sales.’ On the right, include a tilted mobile app mockup or product preview card with soft shadows. Below the hero, add a subtle ‘Trusted by’ strip with grayscale client logos in a single row. Use Indigo (#6366F1) as the primary accent for CTAs and highlights, hover state in darker Indigo (#4F46E5), background light gray (#F9FAFB), headings dark gray (#111827), paragraphs medium gray (#6B7280), borders/dividers soft gray (#E5E7EB). Keep the style minimal, spacious, with generous whitespace, smooth 8px corner radii, subtle drop shadows, and clear visual hierarchy. Navigation is simple with logo left, links centered or right, and a small accent button. Overall tone: trustworthy, professional, and conversion-focused.”
